    text: " <p> With the first week of interactive media done, I am pretty excited to dive right in and learn all there is to good web design as well as attempt to master this new skill. The only things to do was to have MS Teams and Git setup as well as to pick a reading to go through. I already had GitHub set up from last year, but I never really took the time to learn how to use it properly, and don't have any experience using it within a team project. With the help of the internet though, all questions seemingly have a solution. I watched a simple tutorial just to cover the ideas of pushing, pulling and merging branches etc. So, it wasn't too bad, and I realize it's not as complicated as I thought it would be so I could have just taken the time back then as well. </p>"+

    " <p> Speaking of the internet and it being a place where \"all questions seemingly have a solution\", I think of Vannevar Bush's reading which was the one I chose to go through. \"What are the scientists to do next?\" was the question that stuck out to me the most. With peace approaching again, it made it sound like what we know as the internet today was the next step in our advancement. That next step was being able to share information, discoveries and knowledge in an effective and easy manner by virtue of us being connected by a network. Through that connection, the work of the scientists from around the world would enable them to achieve their best again on different terms. Fast forward to the present day and I believe it is fair to say that the internet has become quite an integral part of the day to day lives of not just the scientists but of us all as it exists as this massive repository of information. </p>" +
    
   " <p> My goals for this course are to acquire and polish the necessary skills for web development. I'm not completely new to HTML, CSS and JavaScript but I have forgotten most of what I learnt which is why I do look forward to the prospect of being able to be good at using them and retain that knowledge for the future. I'm also hopeful that I'll be able to gain the sense of good and bad UI/UX design and just use that to hopefully see what kind of creative things can be done with the functionality these languages provide. </p> "

      text: " <p> Starting with HTML was particularly interesting. It is rather simple and feels like the first step to organizing what your web page will look like. I enjoy how it is effectively the skeleton of everything on your web page, dictating where and how things should be. As I mentioned, its simple enough as it helps you achieve the goal of organizing your web page through HTML tags and elements. So all you need to do really is be aware of the tags at your disposal, and then also be aware of the information you have for your website as well as the concept for your website. The concept is the most important part as that is effectively the guiding light for how you structure the information, and it will eventually play into the way you style your web page. </p> " + 

      "<p> The readings were particularly interesting for me since they tackled a concept I honestly had not thought of very much when it comes to web development and that is accessibility. Accessibility is a very important thing because we as developers are in a sense abiding to a design principle in which we make it possible for all people to be capable of engaging, interacting and well, accessing the information we provide. It really is eye-opening to all the possible ways that semantic markup can help make our web pages even more usable. The importance of semantic markup was also something I did not initially think had as much significance but as it would turn out, it is incredibly useful for search engine optimization. We find the reason why when we look at why we even set up our websites in the first place. So why do we create web pages? There is a multitude of reasons, but they all draw back to us wanting people to use the data we put up, and working with the web crawler can help ensure that there is a decent number of people reading the information we set up.</p> " ,},

    text:" <p>With the creation of the website, everything is still very much within the bare bones stages in which I am still trying to figure out exactly what it is that I want to go for in terms of the design. I have been several websites for some decent inspiration. I can take my website in a couple directions, and it probably feels that way because of my concern over the colour scheme. I don’t really want to be pinned down to a very minimalist all white design or something along those lines even though it may be the best route for a starter in web design to take. Homing in on a few ideas could result in a much more focused design. </p> "+

    " <p>So while I can’t think of a good concept and colour scheme I want to stick to, I think that thinking of my webpage in terms of its wireframes is a good starting point and eventually, meat can be put on the proverbial skeleton of html. Performing the crazy 8 mock up was also a decent exercise that really helped me create a mental map of what I need to do in order to accomplish a website and it didn’t feel too complicated or anything. </p> "+

    " <p> The reading on Convention and context was a very interesting read for me. It delved into the topic of convention which can be described as shared practices. A collective of individuals would thus adhere to a convention to perform a certain action or task and anything not part of that convention counts as unconventional.</p> "+

    " <p>We then have traditional conventions which recognise past regularities and through that inform those in the present to keep repeating those regularities in their action. Meanwhile prescriptive conventions are different in that they are seen as a recommend course of action during a particular situation. It is then important to note that context factors into the application of conventions in situations. So even though traditional conventions are followed, there is still variance within work that is made using such conventions. Historical context as well as the uniqueness of an individual will be able to create something that is still different and unique. Meanwhile when it comes to prescriptive conventions, these are very much bound to specific situations and the context of those situations. It, for example, considers what is respectful or kind within certain situations. Context is very important as it points out differences that are not recognized within convention. Which is why we can even further say that context consists of conventional and non-conventional features. </p> "+

    " <p>So, what is the exact importance of trying to understand and define convention as well as context? How does it eventually tie back to UI and UX? This reading felt to me like it was very much geared towards students of literature because those were the explanations that made me really understand what they meant and how these concepts are in our unconscious knowledge and at the same time, how they can be applied for great effect within multiple fields and vocations. If conventions are shared practices that are while not necessarily the best practices, but rather the most widely used practices, we can then look at the things that stand out against the convention and use them to elicit very strong reactions. When something is done in an unconventional manner, its new, its different and its shocking. It stands out from the rest for better or for worse. Which is why we need to be very deliberate when we decide to go against the grain and not merely for the sake of shock value. So, when we apply a lens of UI and UX to this, if a person were to drag a scroll bar down, they would expect the screen to move downwards. So, if it goes sideways, it goes against their expectations a bit. It might make them feel like they are reading a type of book and find it pleasant. And that can be a good thing. But it can be bad when a user has expectations on how something in your UI/UX might function and then it goes completely against that. The design just ends up feeling not very intuitive and it leads to an overall unpleasant experience. That is something we are trying to avoid. </p> "+

    " <p> My favourite part of the reading was where Culler in Structuralist Poetics basically argues that interpretive conventions are procedures not for the reader, but rather for the writer who constitutes text with those properties. It particularly resonated with me because it sort of answered the question I had when I used to do English Literature in high school. That question being did the poets really intend us to see all these things or are we as readers imparting too much meaning into what we are reading. Surely its not that deep. And well, this part of the text somewhat confirms to me that as a reader, you do draw your own meaning from a text by the context of which you think of the world and relate to certain concepts but at the same time, there was still authorial intention. Which might be why we do find a lot of enjoyment in art that has room for interpretation. It is not always everyone’s cup of tea, but it really allows us to think about things a lot more and it can be quite rewarding for some in that sense as opposed to having everything laid out for one as clear as day. Its also worth noting that writers learning analytic procedure means that writes are essentially “students of the game” and insert their intention into their work and design. It answers the question of why as students we might have to learn all these literary devices or why we need to think critically about pre-existing works of art and why we analyse the past and see where conventions are followed and not. It’s likely that having to think that much about things, eventually has those techniques passively seep into our headspace and the work we create because of how we have been critically thinking about a lot of these things.So, this study of convention as well as context is applicable to not just UI/UX but also a lot more disciplines.</p>"

It really harkens back to just how important it is to sort of have a good idea of what you want to go for. I was getting to play around with colour schemes as well to really get a feel of what I like.

    " <p>UI relates to interactivity in a very interesting way in that the Interface is the medium between the system we have and the user. The interactivity of the interface is what aids users in understanding the state of the system. Users do not need to question “what page am I on?” or “have I added anything to my cart?”. The goal at the end of the day is to have an interface that through the model of a sign constituting of a signifier and the signified, works in harmony with that so that it is easy for users to understand and work with. </p>" + 
    
    " <p> The reading that I read was the one that focused on the basic principles of user interface design. It really hammered home the point of how important a good user experience is and that a good interface is really one that is based on making things as easy as possible for the user. I think the point I liked the most was about how a decent goal to have is one in which the interface design feels invisible to the user. Invisibility in this sense is a good thing because it means that nothing about the UI is bothersome or trivial or difficult to understand. It speaks to an interface that is as streamlined as possible and achieves the goal of being so easy to use that you just focus on the information that you came to interact with. This also ties back to last weeks reading on conventions because its in our best interest to use conventions of website interfaces to make it easier for users that visit our site. Overall the biggest take away from this week was how important it is to know the goal you wish to achieve with your website, and aim for that</p>"

    " <p> Alignment - The goal of my overall website is to create a website that is simple and quite minimal in design whilst still having aspects that add a type of boldness to design. What I mean by that is really to keep it simple but not to make it feel too simple or too basic in presentation visually. My users are people that are interested with my work as a student so that means it will likely be people in my field. Information Structure – I did not do this step with any mind maps or the like, but I have thought of how my information is to be grouped together and really it is just based on the different existing web pages. Everything relevant to a page will exist on that page. User Flow– The users reach the homepage and are given a brief introduction to the page. They also have a navigation bar with which they will use to navigate the site and access whatever information they need. If they reach the bottom of a page, in the footer exists a back to the top button. Interface Elements – The existing interface element is a navigation bar with the name of multiple pages on the site as well as button links that can be clicked by the user. </p> " +
    
    " <p> The weeks reading was interesting in that it mainly focused on the rising importance of UX within multiple industries. It also did this by comparing what we know as usability with human computer interaction (HCI). HCI did understand that the user experience was of importance but at the same time, it was a concept that mainly focused on usability and reducing as many errors as possible within an interface. Meanwhile the distinction with UX is that realises that there is so much more that can be done to improve a user’s experience than just providing an interface that is absent of issues. </p> "},

    text:" <p>The readings made me consider the implications of epistemicide and the global hegemony of information that currently exists on the internet. The two readings relate in that they both explore the locality of digital information about a geographical area and they both explore the uneven geographical participation and representation of data. The first reading by Graham, “Towards a Study of information geographies” explored the distribution of information through the lens of geography, while the second reading “Digital Hegemonies” mainly investigated the possible reason and explanation for the digital hegemony and strongest indicator of the locality of information. This points to the possibility of socioeconomic systems that produce high-quality research tending to be highly visible in an online context. As pointed out in this reading, the issue does not exist in the diverse range of sources of information but rather that those sources are dominated by the Global North. </p> " +

    " <p>My thinking of web development as an individual related to my geographical area that exists in the global south is now mainly around the fact that consistent work and effort needs to be made to counter the status quo. The situation is not truly alleviating in the less developed countries, so the hope that entering the new “Information Era” would lead to a world in which digital information is more democratized is but a falsehood.   </p> " +

    " <p> The most concerning part of this deals with how places that are invisible in their representation become equally invisible in practice to many people. That is a devastating predicament in which a group of people feels unheard, unseen, and unnoticed by the world. Their narratives and stories remain invisible because of their lack of the power that exists in information. </p> " +

    text:" <p>The reading explored for this week was by Magenya, “Making a Feminist Internet in Africa”.  Magenya is noted as a feminist writer interested in the opportunities that African women have to cause change within social and political spaces.  </p> " +

    " <p> It was an article written during the period of Covid which helps contextualize the reading better. The effects of Covid led to an attitude held by many in which the solution to the social isolation was to “just meet online”. Magenya however opposes this idea by claiming that the ability and privilege to just meet online with the use of the internet is not the simple solution to this social problem. She describes that solution as a “silver bullet that imagines an equality of access, use, and representation on the internet”. That is however not the case in the world we currently live in and the previous week began exploring the idea of digital hegemonies and the inequality that exists online that is uncovered through analyzing the geography of information.</p> " +

    " <p> Magenya makes a call within the text to counter this current situation by appealing to African feminists to step up and show how the playing field has not been leveled by technology and it remains an infallible solution. The first step that was made within Africa was a gathering at the MFIAfrcia in 2019. The event “gathered a diverse group of African activists, thinkers, artists, and feminists to talk about technology, the internet, and the power and impact it has on all our lives.”</p> " +

    " <p>Magenta makes an important point about how the internet has currently morphed into something that “feels like a brave new world in danger of mirroring oppressive norms and ideas that have existed in the unequal world we have lived in”. There are a lot of bigoted actors that exist on the internet that attack women and LGBTQIA people and get away with it. The hate towards people that do not conform has been somewhat normalized, but Magenya suggests that in diverse groups standing up to this, change can be made. The change that can be made by making the internet more feminist exists in that we get to regain control of the narratives related to us and we also try to make the internet a much kinder place.  </p> " +

    " <p> The reason so much bigotry, racism, and homophobia almost seems protected and normalized on the internet is the very disconnect it has with the majority of its users not acting as they would in the world. There is not enough effort to try to understand the various problems of people from different groups, and as such despite the internet being an unequal space, kindness and care are needed to try to treat this. Magenya points out that for this to happen, more African feminists need to “take up space on the internet to tell more stories and provide alternative views” to ultimately let the heteronormative status quo know that these people will not disappear, and neither will their voices.</p> "

    " <p> The reading for the week was The Road to Techno-colonialism by Verdi. One of the major geopolitical implications of AI is that due to the existing duopoly of the technology, AI can be used to further extend the influence and power of Sino-America. AI can provide more power to international states making use of it since it has major economic benefits and is currently transforming military operations. These two factors are very important in that they can be equated to the power a state holds. The problem with this however is that very few states have developed National strategies on AI.</p> " +


    " <p> The danger of this thus lies in the power imbalance that exists as most countries simply do not have the proper infrastructure to develop their own AI systems and will have to turn to China or America. The techno-colonial relationship presents itself through this dilemma as the AI Superpowers are in full control of the terms that they exercise, with clients needing to abide by the will of the superpowers otherwise they could face limitations. This leads to a society in which big corporations make use of their competitive control to exercise control to gain control over dependent states. Very Cyberpunk. </p> " +

The reason it exists and has been fostered in the first place is that code is not truly as neutral as we are led to believe. The choices of the literacy or code signs used within programming are driven by the requirements of the project and the purpose of the program, but also by the social understanding of the programmers behind it. </p> " +

    " <p> With that in mind, by being critical when it comes to our code and aware of the possible implications within our code, we can begin the journey to effect lasting change in our sector. So, to look at my code as an example and to try to identify anything to be aware of, I just mainly need to be thinking about why I make the decisions I do and if they might have any possible effects that play into larger systems. Since it is a very new concept to me, it is a bit difficult to think of proper examples from the very small applications that my code is being used for but using lessons learned so far from within the course, I can start my thinking at accessibility. How accessible is the code I am writing? Within a South African context where most of the populous accesses the internet from mobile devices, I can ask myself if I am barring the information I make on my current or future websites/projects from an entire group of people. That is an important question to think of, consider and enact within my code. </p> "

The reading tackles the idea of whether some sociotechnical systems should be developed in the first place. The reading makes the argument that a lot of the systems such as facial recognition and predictive policing for example are inherently designed “on myriad a of human prejudicial biases and assumptions”. The reading brings up the example of facial recognition surveillance technologies being used within the United States policing system. A system that has a history of anti-black oppression and racism. A technology created within the confines of an unjust system is bound to be assigned and further exacerbate those unjust attitudes. The reading delves into the “history of measuring bodies of black bodies, turning those measurements into data and then building systems of values, beliefs, and predictions off of that data.” Those beliefs and predictions are harmful stereotypes that were being perpetuated within the media of the time. Those beliefs, coupled with outcomes of experiments and measurements became the base of algorithmic data and equations used to train many systems in place. Thus why the argument is made for whether or not such technologies can even be developed and explored in the first place before the current unjust societal norms are critiqued, analyzed, and challenged.

The argument the reading makes is that the internet affects our morals because of how just how different social interactions there are from how things are in the real world. Factors like anonymity can push people to act more rudely towards others because they don’t believe they will even ever have to face the consequences of their actions. It gives a sense of protection and provides a space in which a lot of behaviours will not face the necessary scrutiny. Similar to the reading I tackled in Week 9, the normal desire to try to reach a mutual understanding with the other person or even to be tolerant is not as great because it is so dissimilar from our world. A positive example still exists in that the Internet can also help facilitate greater opportunities for solidarity between groups to help push activism on a global scale. </p> " +

    " <p>The implications of the reading suggest that we need to find a means to develop “ethical frameworks and guidelines” for online behaviour. We must be mindful of how we interact with others over the internet and any possible effects our actions might cause. </p> " +

    " <p> To go off on a slight tangent, I liked how the video game Death Stranding (directed and written by Hideo Kojima from Kojima Productions) tackled interaction between players. The game is set in a post-apocalyptic world that mirrors what the Covid pandemic looked like because people are forced into having to exist in isolation from each other. The game is all about reconnecting the United Cities of America by building structures and one big network. Now the way it plays into the interaction between users: structures built within the game can be used by other players, so when you create a bridge, you not only get to create it for yourself but for any future players that travel the same route that you have. Players can then only interact positively with the structure that has been built by giving it a thumbs up. There are no thumbs down or ways to engage negatively within the game which is fascinating but also creates an experience based on positivity and kindness. So, I mainly bring it up as it is a fascinating way to tie up the entire design process towards the goal of creating only positive experiences between players. So, as we exist in a space that is trying to design a lot more critically and place values at the forefront of what we do, it is something that came to mind.</p> " +
