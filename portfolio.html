        <p>
          My name is Michael Anokye-Boateng and I am currently studying my BEng in Digtal Arts. It is sometimes easy to forgot about the cool stuff that we do whilst busy dealing with assignments but it is some pretty cool stuff that has always piqued my interest. I have always been into video games and I personally consider it tp be the artisctic discipline that I could be best suited for. Game Design is definetely not easy and ideas around creating mechanics can be very confusing. How do you innovate brand new mechanics, plan to balance out game levels and move forward into the space of implemtenting on a technical level. It is a challenge but one I do believe I enjoy. </p>

          My biggest inspirations in the world of game design, - and even movies - is definetely Hideo Kojima and I haven't even played that many metal gear games as they were mostly from before my time. Although what I do admire the most is Kojima's willingness to keep exploring new things, new art and to also try to always showcase innovation in design. It is quite admirable to be driven by that simple desire to just try things slightly differently. That is a philosophy that I try to employ when things are relatively calm in terms of pressure. To try do things that I consider to be fun and enjoyable but to also try things that become a really great learning experience and add to my overall skill because I left my design comfort zone.

          In terms of games I enjoy, I realize that I am a very big fan of rpgs and narrrative driven games mainly because of the fact that they allow me as a player to well, "roleplay" and truly immerse myself in an entirely different and fascinating world. This is part of the reason why I love games like The Witcher 3 and DIsco Elysium because they really make you feel as though you are part of the world. My goals for this degree and the future in general are centered around the hopes that I can eventually someday be in a position to contribute to the world of video games and Interactive Media. 
        </p>

        <p>I will be walking you through some of the creations I have come up with from the past, and the idea is to at the very least, keep making better and better projects as time progresses.</p>
