          Goal Alignment - The goal was to have a design that simple and minimal
          in design that is easy to use for users while still being visually
          pleasing. With that in place, it is my hope that users effortlessly
          access the information they want to access.
        </p>
        <p>
          Information Structure - The information that us on the screen is all
          related to my weekly progress in learning all about web development
          languages. The content is mapped out in accordance with the pages that
          I have, and everything is grouped together in that sense. Meanwhile
          the homepage is to act as an overview of the entire site’s contents.
        </p>
        <p>
          User Flow - When the user accesses the homepage, they are greeted with
          short summaries of what exists in parts of the site, and the
          navigation bar is always accessible so that users have the choice and
          option to navigate to whatever information they need.
        </p>
        <p>
          Interface Elements - There is a navigational element in the form of a
          navigation bar, and this navigation bar is populated with buttons that
          when clicked take you to other pages on the site. I made sure to
          represent them by making the background of the navbar darker, and by
          allowing the buttons to be highlighted on hover. However, JavaScript
          would help this process a lot more.
        </p>
        <h3>Style process documentation</h3>
        <p>
          There was a lot of inspiration as reference for this website. The
          biggest website influence was the Santa Monica Studios official
          webpage. It is so simple and yet so appealing to the eye. Another
          reason I wanted to double down on the minimalist aesthetic was because
          of the site myFriendNed which is a model agency website and it’s very
          elegant, very simple and very minimalist but just a bit too minimalist
          for me to want to emulate.
        </p>
        <p>
          The colour scheme I decided to go with was purely based on the anime
          movie Akira’s posters which use bright red, white and black. That was
          the biggest influence for the look of this website including its
          font-style. Although I had to balance the desire to do too much with
          these colours and also my lack of experience in this design, by
          sticking to a more minimalist approach. It is part of the reason why
          white is the primary colour instead of something like black or dark
          grey. I do also think I used the fonts adequately because I allowed
          some titles to be bold, and have impact while using legible font
          families for the information there is to read.

          <h2>Style Guides</h2>
          <p>
            The direction guiding the design of this website was always moving
            towards a minimal aesthetic that avoided the most bold of colours
            while maintaining aesthetic appeal in its simplicity aand use of
            white space and the colour white. It is a website that hopes to keep
            things interesting by keeping things simple.
          </p>

          <p>
            As mentioned above, the major influences for the web page was the
            Santa Monica Studios website which is simple but maximizes on its
            limited colour scheme with beautiful and smooth transitions on the
            page and utilizing whitespace effectively.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is why I have decided with the final design to keep things as
            simple and uniform as before.
          </p>

        <h3>Adjusted IxD process</h3>
        <p>
          Goal Allignment- The website continues down the path of keeping things
          simple and trying to rather maximize the legibility of information on
          the page. This decision meant that the large sectons of the website
          that had a red background with white text were removed as it was
          slightly difficult for users to read which is not good for the
          accessibility of the page.
        </p>
        <p>
          Information Structure - Information on the website is stored in its
          related areas and users have the ability to navigate to whichever page
          they wish to go to when they have to since the navigation bar is
          sticky. The homepage also serves as a guide to the contents of the
          page and provide.
        </p>
        <p>
          Interface Elements - Interface elements were mostly constructed with
          the use of buttons and the colour red as an indicator. Thus when users
          hover over any item that they can interact with, it gets highlighted
          with the red/crimson colour and they are made aware of the fact that
          it is an interaction point. These buttons use javascript to provide
          navigation for the page.
        </p>
        <h3>How UI and UX impact the code</h3>
        <p>
          In terms of folder structure for the page, it is representative of how
          the page functions visually as all five pages are separated with their
          own related information tied to the individual page. All uses of
          Javascript, CSS and HTML are kept separated from each other in
          different layes and only linked to each other by pages that require
          them so as to avoid any in-line styling with CSS. There is also a
          javascript file made specifically for the blog page, and it stores the
          weekly dev blogs and contains the logic needed for that page to run.
          It is not linked to any other HTML file except for the page that needs
          it's use.
        </p>
        <p>
          Semantic markup makes use of appropriate elements that offer some
          semantic meaning to the information stored within such as articles
          using blogs and an effort is made to provide ARIA labels to sections
          as well as alt text to images displayed.The use of the black text on
          white background instead of using a wider ranger of colours was also a
          choice to make it easier for users with impaired sight to read
          information of the webpage easier. There certainly are elements of the
          CSS and responsive layouts that can be implemetnted to make the
          website look better on a mobile device which is an issue that needs to
          be fixed, but queries were still used to try maintain usabilty of the
          web page on those smaller devices.
