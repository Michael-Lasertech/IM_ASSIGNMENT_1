          <h2 id=\"essayTitle\">Gumtree Critique</h2>"
          <p>
            1 Introduction The website I decided to analyse was the Gumtree
            website (Gumtree.co.za). The main reason for this being that they
            provide a useful service to people within the country of South
            Africa in which they get to purchase or sell any items they wish to.
            The web developers at Gumtree have the responsibility to deliver a
            site that is usable for all people seeking the service on whatever
            platform they may be using. Due to the service that they facilitate,
            which involves the use of sensitive information like contact
            information, they also have a strong imperative to try make sure
            that users of the website that sell items are not frauds or people
            with malicious intent. The Gumtree website operates itself with the
            user’s best interest in mind. Their UI and UX design is acceptable
            overall, although there are certainly places that could be improved
            upon and tweaked when it comes to the presentation of items and the
            interface.
          </p>

          <p>
            2 UX Elements and IA Interface While the screen can at times feel a
            bit too cluttered with multiple elements presented at a time, it is
            still an overall a visually appealing site and a lot of those
            on-screen items are required. There is also a good amount of
            navigation tools present to the user so that they can easily and
            quickly search for what they want and apply the appropriate
            features.
          </p>
          <p>
            2. 1 Information Presentation The user interface for the most part
            addresses the potential needs users might have by instantly making
            the most important information more prominent at each step. For the
            most part, users can access whatever information it is that they may
            be curious about finding. The most important information on the
            website stands out for users to identify. This information is placed
            in the biggest box containers with larger text and a foreground
            colour that differentiates it from the page background. An example
            of this can be seen on the homepage of the web site, where the most
            important information about topics such as safely trading on the
            website is placed in big containers with a colourful background.
          </p>
          <p>
            2.2 Functionality In terms of the overall functionality of the
            website, it is for the most part responsive to screen size changes
            which is a very important aspect. The background colour of a
            particular section, along with the list of items within that section
            do not perfectly fit as the item boxes overlap the background colour
            in which they are supposed to be contained in. Although this one of
            the only issues found with responsiveness. The other one being as
            the screen size increases and we utilise larger screens, they tend
            to not be as optimized to utilise space as well as they could have
            been. For the largest screen, it feels like this could have been
            done to allow space for adds but it overall detracts from the visual
            appeal of the website, when we discuss topics about visual weight
            because the width of the screen doesn’t feel fully utilized. It is
            therefore reasonably responsive with only a few issues, while
            remaining useful for a wide range of users that can only access the
            website on certain devices. The ease of use and functionality is
            maintained across multiple platforms/devices.
          </p>
          <p>
            2.3 Number and complexity of choices The number and complexity of
            choices on the website remain practical. The website has a lot of
            categories but that is mainly due to it catering to multiple items
            and products that are for sale. That plays into the overall
            functionality available to the user and so the large number of
            categories is reasonable. It also makes sure to present users with
            actions they may want to utilise when trying to commit a purchase
            like being able to filter their searches, and order how the results
            are returned, or even an input field where they can suggest an offer
            price to a seller. It overall does not take too long to make
            decisions on what to do when the moment comes because processes are
            not too complex and the objects on the screen are rarely
            overwhelming in presentation.
          </p>
          <p>
            2.4 Incomplete or interrupted tasks There is a system that will
            indicate users when a task is incomplete, however it is not as clear
            as it could be. It is a pop up with a limited duration that will
            show up each time a user navigates around the web site, but opting
            for something that is a lot more permanent could be a better choice
            than the disappearing pop up. There is also no indication of the
            number of items liked which would be useful as a visual indicator
            and reminder to users that there are some items in which they are
            considering purchasing. It could have made this way for simplicity
            and that the button for all the saved items is present, it would be
            a useful tool and reminder so returning users can always pick up
            from where they left off when revisiting the site.
          </p>
          <p>
            2.4 Navigation Gumtree uses a wide range of good navigation tools
            that ease the experience for users significantly. The search
            functionality comes coupled with filters that help users tailor
            their searches to what they are looking for and specify things as
            much as they possibly can. An example of this is the “filter and
            refine” options that allow a user to specify a price range of a
            search as well as whether that price might be negotiable or fixed.
            This was a necessary feature for Gumtree to implement as a service
            since it is based on users finding what they wish to purchase. The
            only drawback when It comes to ease of navigation on the website is
            the lack of tools that make traversal a lot faster. The navigation
            bar does not move as users scroll down a page, and there are no
            buttons that jump to specific sections like a back to top button.
            Having such a feature set would make navigation that much easier, as
            users could jump between sections and categories that much quicker.
            Call to action elements on the web page are good at guiding users to
            any actions they may wish to perform on the web page. They are made
            distinct and clear most of the time as big green buttons that can be
            clicked on, and are also placed in areas users would easily spot.
            The placement of the post free add button being at the top right of
            the navigation bar is good for when users first navigate to page but
            the only downside with this button is that it is not always present
            due to the navigation bar sticking at the top. The “post an add”
            button is a very important feature and it being more reachable and
            easily identifiable would be a benefit.
          </p>
          <p>
            3 UI Elements The UI design is visually appealing and smartly
            combines the colour scheme of green, ivory, black and light brown to
            create a web page that seems to be presenting a friendly and
            comfortable demeanour. Green is a very down–to–earth color that can
            have a balancing and harmonizing effect and is very stable. Brown
            helps bring a feeling of warmth and wholesomeness to designs. Ivory
            - In design, ivory can lend a sense of elegance and calm to a site.
            [4] All of these add up to build that comforting effect. The website
            aims to feel user-friendly and create a sense of comfort. The
            company states on their about page that they are "a place everyone
            trusts, a familiar space that’s easy to navigate, and a classified
            site that just works – whether via your mobile phone or
            desktop."[3]. The use of soft shapes and lighter colours point to
            how the web page is primary trying to make users feel more invited
            and at-ease. Buttons on website are made with rounded edges, and the
            icons for the categories are made with a variety of pastel colours.
          </p>
          <p>
            The font selected for the web page is both easy and comfortable for
            users to read mainly because of the use of a very simple font that
            is very legible and it reasonably spaced. The colour scheme also
            mainly contrasted well enough by using dark colours on a light
            background and vice versa in other sections like the navigation
            panel, or the footer. The elements of the page are aligned and there
            is a very deliberate focus on harmony within the design and
            placement of information to further enhance that feeling of trust
            and comfort.

            4 Ethics of Design Gumtree as a website works for the users best
            interests for the most part but there are still a few issues within
            their ethics that can be improved upon. The site is usable and
            simplified for users and meets the visual presentation standard that
            they need to, however the one unethical pattern I managed to
            identify was that the web page will automatically tick a box to sign
            up to their newsletter service, and the responsibility is on users
            to spot that and decide whether or not they wish to receive those
            promotions. The only issue with this is that it is an option that
            could be made more transparent to users.
          </p>
          <p>
            4.1 Privacy and security for users As a website that supports
            interaction between real people that will end up trading with each
            other, it is own Gumtree to try enforce that users that sell on
            their site are legitimate people that sell items in good faith. They
            perform this well by providing articles based around user safety and
            security, and this information is given priority on the presentation
            of the page. Verified users that present information are also
            granted greater priority on searches which creates a positive
            culture within the user base that sells. The web page also presents
            key information about the people you will be making your purchase
            from, such as what types of verification methods they have carried
            out and how long they have been selling on the website. This effort
            to make this as transparent as possible is commendable ethically and
            goes to show how Gumtree prioritises the user's needs and presents
            benevolent intent. There is still however responsibilty on Gumtree
            to also use the user information that they collect from users in an
            ethical manner since they also verify sensitive documents such as
            IDs and Passports.
          </p>
          <p>
            4.2 Accessibility To test the web page for accessibility, I used
            Accessibility Checker which is a free web-based audit tool that
            scans your website for major legislation's around the world. Upon
            analyses, the gumtree website failed some cases that would provide
            accessibility to visually impaired users that may need to use a
            screen reader. These included a lack of unique ARIA ID's and access
            key values which become a problem when these users might not have
            enough information on the description of links. It is an issue for
            their usability and experience of the page.
          </p>
          <p>
            5 Conclusion In conclusion, Gumtree as a website provides makes
            effort to provide the service, they do for users ethically. The user
            experience is designed to be easy and usable for customers and the
            user interface aims to create a sense of comfort and trust with
            users. There are a few short comings that however could be improved
            upon.
