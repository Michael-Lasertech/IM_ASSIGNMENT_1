          1 Introduction The website I decided to analyse was the Gumtree
          website (Gumtree.co.za). The main reason for this being that they
          provide a useful service to people within the country of South Africa
          in which they get to purchase or sell any items they wish to. The web
          developers at Gumtree have the responsibility to deliver a site that
          is usable for all people seeking the service on whatever platform they
          may be using. Due to the service that they facilitate, which involves
          the use of sensitive information like contact information, they also
          have a strong imperative to try make sure that users of the website
          that sell items are not frauds or people with malicious intent. The
          Gumtree website operates itself with the user’s best interest in mind.
          Their UI and UX design is acceptable overall, although there are
          certainly places that could be improved upon and tweaked when it comes
          to the presentation of items and the interface.
        </p>

        <p>
          2 UX Elements and IA Interface While the screen can at times feel a
          bit too cluttered with multiple elements presented at a time, it is
          still an overall a visually appealing site and a lot of those
          on-screen items are required. There is also a good amount of
          navigation tools present to the user so that they can easily and
          quickly search for what they want and apply the appropriate features.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. 1 Information Presentation The user interface for the most part
          addresses the potential needs users might have by instantly making the
          most important information more prominent at each step. For the most
          part, users can access whatever information it is that they may be
          curious about finding. The most important information on the website
          stands out for users to identify. This information is placed in the
          biggest box containers with larger text and a foreground colour that
          differentiates it from the page background. An example of this can be
          seen on the homepage of the web site, where the most important
          information about topics such as safely trading on the website is
          placed in big containers with a colourful background.
        </p>
        <p>
          2.2 Functionality In terms of the overall functionality of the
          website, it is for the most part responsive to screen size changes
          which is a very important aspect. The background colour of a
          particular section, along with the list of items within that section
          do not perfectly fit as the item boxes overlap the background colour
          in which they are supposed to be contained in. Although this one of
          the only issues found with responsiveness. The other one being as the
          screen size increases and we utilise larger screens, they tend to not
          be as optimized to utilise space as well as they could have been. For
          the largest screen, it feels like this could have been done to allow
          space for adds but it overall detracts from the visual appeal of the
          website, when we discuss topics about visual weight because the width
          of the screen doesn’t feel fully utilized. It is therefore reasonably
          responsive with only a few issues, while remaining useful for a wide
          range of users that can only access the website on certain devices.
          The ease of use and functionality is maintained across multiple
          platforms/devices.
        </p>
        <p>
          2.3 Number and complexity of choices The number and complexity of
          choices on the website remain practical. The website has a lot of
          categories but that is mainly due to it catering to multiple items and
          products that are for sale. That plays into the overall functionality
          available to the user and so the large number of categories is
          reasonable. It also makes sure to present users with actions they may
          want to utilise when trying to commit a purchase like being able to
          filter their searches, and order how the results are returned, or even
          an input field where they can suggest an offer price to a seller. It
          overall does not take too long to make decisions on what to do when
          the moment comes because processes are not too complex and the objects
          on the screen are rarely overwhelming in presentation.
        </p>
        <p>
          2.4 Incomplete or interrupted tasks There is a system that will
          indicate users when a task is incomplete, however it is not as clear
          as it could be. It is a pop up with a limited duration that will show
          up each time a user navigates around the web site, but opting for
          something that is a lot more permanent could be a better choice than
          the disappearing pop up. There is also no indication of the number of
          items liked which would be useful as a visual indicator and reminder
          to users that there are some items in which they are considering
          purchasing. It could have made this way for simplicity and that the
          button for all the saved items is present, it would be a useful tool
          and reminder so returning users can always pick up from where they
          left off when revisiting the site.
        </p>
        <p>
          2.4 Navigation Gumtree uses a wide range of good navigation tools that
          ease the experience for users significantly. The search functionality
          comes coupled with filters that help users tailor their searches to
          what they are looking for and specify things as much as they possibly
          can. An example of this is the “filter and refine” options that allow
          a user to specify a price range of a search as well as whether that
          price might be negotiable or fixed. This was a necessary feature for
          Gumtree to implement as a service since it is based on users finding
          what they wish to purchase. The only drawback when It comes to ease of
          navigation on the website is the lack of tools that make traversal a
          lot faster. The navigation bar does not move as users scroll down a
          page, and there are no buttons that jump to specific sections like a
          back to top button. Having such a feature set would make navigation
          that much easier, as users could jump between sections and categories
          that much quicker. Call to action elements on the web page are good at
          guiding users to any actions they may wish to perform on the web page.
          They are made distinct and clear most of the time as big green buttons
          that can be clicked on, and are also placed in areas users would
          easily spot. The placement of the post free add button being at the
          top right of the navigation bar is good for when users first navigate
          to page but the only downside with this button is that it is not
          always present due to the navigation bar sticking at the top. The
          “post an add” button is a very important feature and it being more
          reachable and easily identifiable would be a benefit.
        </p>
        <p>
          3 UI Elements The UI design is visually appealing and smartly combines
          the colour scheme of green, ivory, black and light brown to create a
          web page that seems to be presenting a friendly and comfortable
          demeanour. Green is a very down–to–earth color that can have a
          balancing and harmonizing effect and is very stable. Brown helps bring
          a feeling of warmth and wholesomeness to designs. Ivory - In design,
          ivory can lend a sense of elegance and calm to a site. [4] All of
          these add up to build that comforting effect. The website aims to feel
          user-friendly and create a sense of comfort. The company states on
          their about page that they are "a place everyone trusts, a familiar
          space that’s easy to navigate, and a classified site that just works –
          whether via your mobile phone or desktop."[3]. The use of soft shapes
          and lighter colours point to how the web page is primary trying to
          make users feel more invited and at-ease. Buttons on website are made
          with rounded edges, and the icons for the categories are made with a
          variety of pastel colours.
        </p>
        <p>
          The font selected for the web page is both easy and comfortable for
          users to read mainly because of the use of a very simple font that is
          very legible and it reasonably spaced. The colour scheme also mainly
          contrasted well enough by using dark colours on a light background and
          vice versa in other sections like the navigation panel, or the footer.
          The elements of the page are aligned and there is a very deliberate
          focus on harmony within the design and placement of information to
          further enhance that feeling of trust and comfort.
        </p>

          4 Ethics of Design Gumtree as a website works for the users best
          interests for the most part but there are still a few issues within
          their ethics that can be improved upon. The site is usable and
          simplified for users and meets the visual presentation standard that
          they need to, however the one unethical pattern I managed to identify
          was that the web page will automatically tick a box to sign up to
          their newsletter service, and the responsibility is on users to spot
          that and decide whether or not they wish to receive those promotions.
          The only issue with this is that it is an option that could be made
          more transparent to users.
        </p>
        <p>
          4.1 Privacy and security for users As a website that supports
          interaction between real people that will end up trading with each
          other, it is own Gumtree to try enforce that users that sell on their
          site are legitimate people that sell items in good faith. They perform
          this well by providing articles based around user safety and security,
          and this information is given priority on the presentation of the
          page. Verified users that present information are also granted greater
          priority on searches which creates a positive culture within the user
          base that sells. The web page also presents key information about the
          people you will be making your purchase from, such as what types of
          verification methods they have carried out and how long they have been
          selling on the website. This effort to make this as transparent as
          possible is commendable ethically and goes to show how Gumtree
          prioritises the user's needs and presents benevolent intent. There is
          still however responsibilty on Gumtree to also use the user
          information that they collect from users in an ethical manner since
          they also verify sensitive documents such as IDs and Passports.
        </p>
        <p>
          4.2 Accessibility To test the web page for accessibility, I used
          Accessibility Checker which is a free web-based audit tool that scans
          your website for major legislation's around the world. Upon analyses,
          the gumtree website failed some cases that would provide accessibility
          to visually impaired users that may need to use a screen reader. These
          included a lack of unique ARIA ID's and access key values which become
          a problem when these users might not have enough information on the
          description of links. It is an issue for their usability and
          experience of the page.
        </p>
        <p>
          5 Conclusion In conclusion, Gumtree as a website provides makes effort
          to provide the service, they do for users ethically. The user
          experience is designed to be easy and usable for customers and the
          user interface aims to create a sense of comfort and trust with users.
          There are a few short comings that however could be improved upon.
